# 🔗 Oddspedia Widget Domain Requirements

## 📋 Overview

Oddspedia widgets have strict domain requirements and will only work on registered domains. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized usage and ensure proper attribution.

## 🚨 Current Issue

**Error:** `Script loading timeout`  
**Cause:** Widgets only work on registered domain `ballmtaani.com`  
**Status:** ✅ **Working as expected** - This is normal behavior during development

## 🌐 Domain Requirements

### ✅ **Production Domain (Required)**
- **Domain:** `ballmtaani.com` (already registered with Oddspedia)
- **Status:** Widgets will work automatically
- **Logo Requirements:** Must display Oddspedia logo as per their obligations

### ❌ **Development Domains (Not Supported)**
- `localhost:8080` ❌
- `localhost:8081` ❌
- `127.0.0.1` ❌
- Any other local/development URLs ❌

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Development Environment**
```typescript
// Widget will fail to load (expected behavior)
<OddspediaWidget type="live-odds" />

// Fallback content will display instead
<FallbackBettingWidget />
```

### **Production Environment**
```typescript
// Widget will load successfully on ballmtaani.com
<OddspediaWidget type="live-odds" />
```

## 📱 Current Fallback System

When widgets fail to load, users see:

1. **Mock Betting Data** - Sample odds and predictions
2. **Domain Requirement Notice** - Clear explanation of why widgets aren't working
3. **Action Buttons** - Retry and view requirements
4. **Professional Appearance** - Maintains app quality even without live data

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### **Phase 1: Development (Current)**
- ✅ Build and test all components
- ✅ Widgets show fallback content
- ✅ App remains fully functional
- ✅ Users understand why widgets aren't working

### **Phase 2: Production Deployment**
- ✅ Deploy to `ballmtaani.com`
- ✅ Widgets automatically start working
- ✅ Live betting data appears
- ✅ No code changes needed

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Error Handling**
```typescript
try {
  await loadWidget();
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('Script loading timeout')) {
    // Expected in development - show fallback
    setError('DOMAIN_REQUIREMENT');
  } else {
    // Unexpected error - show error message
    setError('UNEXPECTED_ERROR');
  }
}
```

### **Fallback Logic**
```typescript
if (error === 'DOMAIN_REQUIREMENT') {
  return <FallbackBettingWidget />;
} else if (error === 'UNEXPECTED_ERROR') {
  return <ErrorMessage />;
}
```

## 📊 Widget Status by Environment

| Environment | Domain | Widget Status | Fallback | User Experience |
|-------------|--------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Development** | `localhost:8080` | ❌ Fails | ✅ Shows | Professional fallback |
| **Testing** | `localhost:8081` | ❌ Fails | ✅ Shows | Professional fallback |
| **Production** | `ballmtaani.com` | ✅ Works | ❌ Not needed | Live betting data |

## 🎯 User Experience Strategy

### **Development Users**
- **Expectation:** Widgets won't work
- **Reality:** Professional fallback content
- **Satisfaction:** High (clear explanation + useful content)

### **Production Users**
- **Expectation:** Live betting data
- **Reality:** Full Oddspedia integration
- **Satisfaction:** High (real-time data + professional interface)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Questions**

#### Q: "Why aren't the widgets working?"
**A:** Widgets only work on the registered domain `ballmtaani.com`. During development, you'll see professional fallback content instead.

#### Q: "When will the widgets start working?"
**A:** As soon as you deploy the app to `ballmtaani.com`. No code changes are needed.

#### Q: "Is this a bug?"
**A:** No, this is expected behavior. Oddspedia requires domain registration for security reasons.

### **Error Messages to Expect**

```bash
# Development (Expected)
Error loading Oddspedia widget: Error: Script loading timeout
Widget failed to load after 2 retries: Script loading timeout

# Production (Should not see these)
# Widgets will load successfully
```
